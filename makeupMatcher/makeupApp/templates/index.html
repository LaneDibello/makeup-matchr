              What is Makeup Matchr?
          </h3>
        <p>
            We made Makeup Matchr because it is incredibly difficult to find a matching foundation by traditional methods. The process of going to a makeup retailer, guessing which foundations may match your specific skin tone, and manually testing each one is very time consuming and inaccessible for some people. Our goal is to streamline the entire process of finding the correct foundation and take all of the guesswork out of this process.
